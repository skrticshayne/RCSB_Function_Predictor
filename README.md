# RCSB_Function_Predictor
RCSB_Unidentified_Protein_Predictor


## PROBLEM 
RCSB PDB(Protein Data Bank) has the structure of thousands of proteins this information includes 3d Structure, secondary structure, sequence, bound ligands(drugs often), other small molecules, and is often associated with an EC number. 
An EC Number is an Enzyme Commission number which is a standaradized format of classification to determine the general function of a protein. Similar proteins often have similar function and the differences is what seperates them into their specificity. However, There are many Unknown protein structures in the RCSB these are real human proteins that someone isolated and crystallized and uploaded the structure to RCSB one example is 2o14 being able to take an unknown protein and get a solid prediction at its EC class wwould allow us to Widely narrow down the function of the protein, Time permetting we could then expand this into Drug Predictions, We could simulate docking of any drug that would likely fit into a protein of that EC class and see how "well" it fits and then get an even closer Prediction to what the proteins actual function is in the body 

# TLDR
Lots of known proteins with known structures and known functions, some proteins with known structures and unknown function, Lets try to predict that function and verify the function by drug binding analysis, If we really really have time we can go to the lab to and give the drug to the protein and see how it does.
